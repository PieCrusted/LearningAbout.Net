1. What happens when you divide an int variable by 0?
This will throw an exception since we cannot divide by 0.

2. What happens when you divide a double variable by 0?
A double or float that gets divide by zero will either return +/- infinity or NaN on (0 / 0).

3. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its
range?
It will wrap around to the other side since ints are implemented in 2's complement so on lets say we have a 4 bit number 0111 or 7, add 1 and it will become 1000 or -8. Same thing for the other side so if we have 1000 or -8 and subtract 1 (by adding 1111) we will get 0111 or 7.

4. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;?
y++ will keep the old y value in the equation while adding 1 to y, but the new y isn't used. On the otherside ++y will first add 1 to y and then the new y is used in the equation.

5. What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop
statement?
break, break out of the loop
continue, finish this iteration and go to the next iteration
return, return from the current function

6. What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required?
There are 3 parts, the initilization, the comparator/conditional statement, and the step. A for loop really only needs the conditional staement so something like for (; i < 50; ) {} is allowed.

7. What is the difference between the = and == operators?
Single = is an assignment operator which if it is assigning a value typed it will assign the new variable a copy of the value while in a reference type it will assign the new variable the memory reference. Double == checks for comparison so if 2 value types are the same then it returns true. In reference types it will compare the memory reference and return true if both variables hold the same reference.

8. Does the following statement compile? for ( ; true; ) ;
It will compile, but it will result in an infinite loop.

9. What does the underscore _ represent in a switch expression?
Underscore acts like a wildcard so it can be anything there and it will satisfy it. So this is similar to the default option if it doesn't satisfy any of them. 

10. What interface must an object implement to be enumerated over by using the foreach
statement?
It must implement the IEnumerable interface.
