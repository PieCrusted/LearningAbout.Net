1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C#?
Strings are immutable meaning they naturally cannot be edited or changed. StringBuilder objects allow editing capabilities to function as a string. Even though there is built in string concatenation through "" + "", it creates a new string each time. On the other hand StringBuilder allows editing the contents without creating new strings each time.

2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
Not sure what this question is asking either it asking for the "parent", so all arrays in C are Array objects, or if its like the base class is the type the arrays can store since arrays can only store all of the same type like int[] or string[] or even object[].

3. How do you sort an array in C#?
You can use the built in Array.sort(arr); which will go in ascending order. You can also do like in Java lamdba expressions like Array.sort( arr, (a, b) =>
    a.compareTo(b)
); to sort it descending (might have mixed up a and b and maybe syntax is wrong).

4. What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in
an array?
The property is Length so you can use arr.Length.

5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
Technically no, it will only be of 1 type, however through inheritance, you can put child class objects in an array set for parent type objects.

6. Whatâ€™s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
CopyTo() will copy the elements of one array into another array that's the same or more size of the original array through arrSrc.CopyTo(arrDest). On the other hand, clone will make a new array that is a clone of the source so to set it would be like string[] arr2 = (string[])arrSrc.Clone();
